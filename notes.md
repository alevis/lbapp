# Describe in your own words what you are building

## 1. Whaat is the core use case, intent, or purpose for your use of Twitter's APIs?
I hope to build an app that would be able to predict lyrical content structure in next popular songs in various genres. 

"I'm using twitter's API to explore similarities between lyrical structures and how they relate to user's usage of language. This will help in the prediction of lyrucal structures/content in various genres."


## 2. Do you intend to analyze Tweets, Twitter users, or their content? If so, share details about the analysis you plan to conduct and the method or techniques you plan to use.
I plan to analyze Tweets to understand what drives user's adoption of popular phrases from songs of various genres.

## 3. Does your use case involve Tweeting. Retweeting, or liking content?
No, my use case does not involve Tweeting.

## 4. How will Twitter data be displayed to users of your solution? If you plan to display Twitter content off of Twitter explain how and where tweets and Twitter content will be displayed to users of your product or service. Will individual Tweets and Twitter content be displayed, or will information about Tweets or Twitter content be displayed in aggregate?

Information about Tweets or Twitter content will be displayed in aggregate.
